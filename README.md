In a scenario where, on the one hand, we have malnutrition and food insecurity affecting thousands of people globally, on the other hand, we have food waste in the proportion of thousands of tons in Brazil alone. In the context of food service and retail establishments such as restaurants, bakeries, markets and hotels that produce food on a daily basis, predicting the amount of food that should be made available to maximize profits without generating financial losses is a complex task. In this sense, this project proposes the development of a technological solution to reduce food waste. The proposal consists of creating a multiplatform application to connect these establishments to people interested in consuming these foods, which should be offered at reduced prices within the platform. Through this application, the aim is to establish a direct link between supply and demand for surplus food, reducing waste and contributing to the construction of a more efficient and equitable food system. Resources similar to this are already part of the daily lives of thousands of people on the European continent, in Brazil it is still a segment unknown by the majority and with great potential for growth.
